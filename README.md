# not-asteroid

Not Asteroid, but a simple clone

## History

This is a simple project I did in C++ for fun back in 2011. I was studying
Physics at the time and had to take a Computer Science class requiring me to
use C++ again. I wrote this project as a fun way to brush up on a few things.

## Requirements

I don't remember a lot of specifics, but these seem to be the base
requirements:

- CMake 2.8
- SDL 1.2
- OpenGL
- Boost
- GLEW

I worked on the game on both Windows and Linux, switching between the two
regularly to ensure it ran well on both platforms.

## Building

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..

## Caveats

There are a few memory leaks and bugs here somewhere. One of these days I'll
update the code and fix a few things.
